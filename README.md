# An Introduction to Geospatial Data Structures in R.

This repo offers a short introduction to dealing with geospatial data structure in R. We will be converting vector data into "sf" objects from the sf package. Then we will perform a short demonstration of the said technique on a dataset on invasive species in the United States. Finally, we will briefly discuss modeling with geospatial data in R.

## Features

- Conversion to "sf" Objects: Learn the essentials of converting vector data into "sf" objects, unlocking the powerful functionalities offered by the sf package.

- Demonstration on Invasive Species Data: Explore a practical application of the introduced techniques with a dataset on invasive species in the United States. Follow along as we conduct a hands-on demonstration to deepen your understanding.

- Introduction to Geospatial Modeling: Delve into the world of geospatial modeling in R, gaining insights into how to effectively model and analyze spatial data.
