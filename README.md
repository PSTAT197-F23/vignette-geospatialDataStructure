# Final-Project

This is a template repository for a group assignment to produce a descriptive analysis of class survey data.

Your repository should contain:

1.  A brief .README summarizing repo content and listing the best references on your topic for a user to consult after reviewing your vignette if they wish to learn more
2.  A primary vignette document that explains methods and walks through implementation line-by-line (similar to an in-class or lab activity)
3.  At least one example dataset
4.  A script containing commented codes appearing in the vignette
